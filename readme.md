## Health Check Mechanism

The application implements a health check mechanism using Spring Boot Actuator. Actuator provides insights into the Spring environment with functions for health checking and metrics gathering. The health check endpoint is exposed over HTTP and JMX.

## Monitoring and Observability

Monitoring and observability are achieved by capturing useful health metrics from Spring Boot applications. These metrics are integrated with popular monitoring tools to predict system health by observing anomalies in metrics like memory utilization, errors, and disk space.

## API Gateway

The API Gateway serves as the entry point into the system, handling all external API requests and routing them to the appropriate microservices. It also performs tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching.

## Eureka Server

Eureka Server is a service registry enabling microservices to discover and communicate with each other. It provides a centralized location for microservices to register themselves, facilitating discovery by other microservices and the API Gateway.

## Payment Processing

The application integrates a payment gateway for secure and seamless transaction processing. It supports various payment methods and ensures the confidentiality of user financial information.

## Future Modules

### Prescription Management
- Manages prescriptions given by doctors to patients.

### Chatbot Integration
- Integrates a chatbot for answering health-related queries.

### Analytics Dashboard
- Provides an analytics dashboard for monitoring application performance and usage.

## Conclusion

The Health Services Application is a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of healthcare services. With its modular architecture and robust technology stack, it offers a scalable and efficient platform for both users and healthcare providers.
